# URL shortener
Simple web app for shortening URLs. Enter URL you want to create shortened version of and get a unique new one.
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. Execute wsgi.py to start the app. 
You can specify host, port or debug mode of the app as keyword parameters in the run() method.
P.S. if you want to start the app non-locally don't forget to do port-forwarding for the application's port.
